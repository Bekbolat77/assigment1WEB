    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Bekbolat. I am a student at Astana IT University. I am from Akkol and i have good friends.In Akkol the nature is very beautiful. There are beautiful forests exactly like in Borovoe. The population is about 15 thousand people. There are four schools and three of them are Russian-language and only one Kazakh, where I studied. In this city I grew up and became who I am now. I am writing all this because I don‚Äôt know what to write and I just want there to be more text. Originally, Coca-Cola really did contain cocaine ‚Äì and that‚Äôs not a myth.

When pharmacist John Pemberton created the drink in 1886 in Atlanta, he wanted it to be a ‚Äúhealing tonic‚Äù for fatigue, headaches, and even depression. The recipe included two main ingredients:

coca leaves (the source of cocaine),

kola nuts (which contain caffeine).

That‚Äôs where the name Coca-Cola came from.

At first, a glass of the beverage could contain up to 9 milligrams of cocaine. In those days, this wasn‚Äôt considered unusual: cocaine was sold in pharmacies, added to medicines, and even recommended as a cure for toothaches or impotence.

The cocaine was gradually removed:

By the early 20th century, people were beginning to realize it could cause addiction.

In 1904, the company switched to using ‚Äúdecocainized‚Äù coca leaves ‚Äì the psychoactive substances were removed, but the flavor remained.

Interestingly, Coca-Cola still uses these leaves today. In the U.S., a single licensed company, Stepan Company, imports coca leaves from Peru and Bolivia, extracts the cocaine for medical use (like surgical anesthesia), and sends the leftover flavoring ingredient to Coca-Cola.

So, the link between Coca-Cola and cocaine technically survives, but without any narcotic effect. </p>
